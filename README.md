Add the current weather of that city (see section below)
 Navigation
Add two <a> tags: "About me" and "My Town" (you can any other tag that you can make clickable)
When "About me" is clicked the 1st Page is shown
When "My Town" is clicked the 2nd Page is shown

Current Weathers
The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from an API and populate it to the UI
You can use an actual Weather API like OpenWeatherMap 
Add a picture next to the temperature text. The picture should be:    
cold.png if the temperature is 10째C or lower
mild.png if the temperature is higher than 10째C  but lower than 20째C
